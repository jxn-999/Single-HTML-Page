This project is a **single-page CV built using only pure HTML**, created as part of the roadmap.sh HTML learning path.

🔗 **Project reference:** [https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv](https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv)

## 📄 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a solid understanding of **semantic HTML** and document structure without relying on CSS or JavaScript for layout or styling (at this stage).

The CV is contained in **one HTML file** and includes personal information, skills, education, experience, and external links.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* HTML5 (pure HTML, no CSS or JavaScript)
* SVG (for vector-based icons)

---

## 📐 Structure & Semantics

The HTML document is structured using semantic elements such as:

* `<header>` for personal information
* `<section>` for logical content grouping
* `<article>` for experience entries
* `<address>` for contact details
* `<ul>` and `<li>` for lists

This ensures:

* Accessibility
* Clean document outline
* Future compatibility with CSS styling

---

## 🔍 SEO & Open Graph

The `<head>` section includes:

* Meta description
* Author meta tag
* Responsive viewport meta tag
* Open Graph (OG) tags for better social media sharing

These elements improve discoverability and preview behavior when sharing the page.

---

## 🖼️ Media & Links

* SVG icons are embedded directly in the HTML
* External links (GitHub, Spotify, YouTube) are included and open in a new tab

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add CSS for layout and visual styling
* Improve typography and spacing
* Optional accessibility enhancements

---

## ✅ Project Status

**Status: FINAL (HTML structure complete)**

The HTML structure is finished and considered final.
Future changes will focus only on:

* CSS styling
* Content updates (text/media)

No further structural HTML changes are required.

---

## 📌 Notes

This project intentionally avoids CSS and JavaScript to focus purely on HTML fundamentals, as required by the roadmap.sh project.
